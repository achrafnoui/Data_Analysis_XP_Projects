# Project : :moneybag: Economic Data Analysis Project with Python Pandas :moneybag:
this is my first project built from Youtube in Data Analysis
# :video_camera: Source : [Rob Mulla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R67XuYc9NQ4)
- Teacher : Rob Mulla
## :wrench: Tools : 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Fred API
## What I learned thought out this project : 
- How to pull Data from Fred website using Fred Agent and using API for the first time
- Plotly is a wonderful tool to build interactive plots , this is my first time but i have a strong feeling that i'll be using them in future web dev projects
- this project is more on the programming side than the analytic side
- i learned how merge data horizontally which is rare thing i do
- you can plot two data in one axis like unemployment rate and participation rate
- i can put multip plot ( in this case like 31 plots ) in one output
